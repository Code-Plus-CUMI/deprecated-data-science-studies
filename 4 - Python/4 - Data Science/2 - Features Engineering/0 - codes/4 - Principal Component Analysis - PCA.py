	** Principal Component Analysis **
	**********************************

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to create new Features
combining other Features. In general, we get these new Features
by tracing diagonal lines (axes) over the scatter plot between the
two features we would like calculate the PCA.

After that, the model will calculate the correlation and the
variance between these two features and return the Components
(new Features).

These new features are called the principal components of the
data. The weights themselves are called loadings. There will be
as many principal components as there are features in the
original dataset: if we had used ten features instead of two,
we would have ended up with ten components.

- PCA Best Practices:

	/ PCA only works with numeric features, like continuous
quantities or counts, so don't forget to Encode the Categorical
Features;

	/ PCA is sensitive to scale. It's good practice to standardize
your data before applying PCA, unless you know you have good
reason not to;

	/ Consider removing or constraining outliers, since they can
have an undue influence on the results;

-*-*-*-*-

- When to use PCA:

    / when the dataset has a bunch of features (data set compression);
    / when the features are multi-colinear (there's a significant 
number of linear correlations between them);
    / when our goal is to apply denoising;
    / when you want to check out whether clusters have similar
properties and attributes

"""
We've selected four features that cover a range of properties.
Each of these features also has a high MI score with the target,
price. We'll standardize the data since these features aren't
naturally on the same scale.

We say that the features are not in the same scale when their
ratio are different in a highly way, such as: person's age and 
salary, while a person's age varies from 0 - 100, the salary can
vary between 1,000 - 1,000,000. There's a huge gap between them,
so we gotta scale the features in order to tthe model doesn't
think that salary is more important than age just because the values
are higher.

This table of loadings is telling us that in the Size component,
Height and Diameter vary in the same direction (same sign), but
in the Shape component they vary in opposite directions (opposite
sign).

In each component, the loadings are all of the same magnitude
and so the features contribute equally in both.
