	** Clustering - Introduction **
	*******************************

	Clustering is a Machine Learning Technique to classify the
datas into groups (clusters) following patterns the algorithm
has learned.

	These patterns are not explicity, that means that once a
model has clustered the datas, it is a task to Data Scientists
figure out what are the patterns and why they have been choosen.

	Versions-wise, there a lot of them, but the two main ones are
K-Means and Hierarchial, being:

	- K-Means Clustering: applies K-Nearest Neighbors to create the
clusters;

	- Hiearchial Clustering: applies K-Neartes Neighbors to create
the clusters AND there is a hierarchial / importance relationship
between the groups.
